When to Use let Over var?
## When to Use `let` Over `var`

### ✅ Use `let` because:
- It provides block scope, reducing unintended bugs.
- It prevents accidental re-declarations.
- It avoids issues with hoisting and TDZ.

### ⚠️ Avoid `var` unless working with legacy JavaScript code.

## JavaScript Statements

1. **Variable Declarations** (`var`, `let`, `const`)
2. **Assignment Statement**
3. **Expression Statements**

    - Examples include `if`, `else`, `switch`, `while`, and `for` loops.
5. **Function Declarations**
6. **Return Statement**
7. **Throw Statement**
8. **Try…Catch Statement**
9. **Break and Continue Statements**

## JavaScript Events

JavaScript Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser. They can be triggered by various user interactions or by the browser itself.

- **Mouse Events**: `click`, `dblclick`, `mousemove`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`
- **Keyboard Events**: `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`
